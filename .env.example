# OpenAI API Key for AI analysis functionality
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Security Notes:
# 1. Never commit your actual .env file to GitHub
# 2. Keep your API keys secure and never share them
# 3. When deploying, use environment variables or secrets manager
# 4. For Replit: Use the Secrets tab to set your environment variables

# Development Tips:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys
# 3. Make sure .env is in your .gitignore (it should be by default)

# Note: When deploying, make sure to set your actual API key
# in the Replit secrets manager, not in this file
